    <h4>
        I don’t even know how to start this. The last two nights at Wembley have been the biggest and best shows of my life. To come
        home to such a response after so long away doing something I never thought I could pull off but did has blown me
        away. However, I’ve struggled vocally both nights. I had to push a lot harder than I normally do. I felt like I constantly
        had to clear my throat, especially last night. I went to see my throat doctor this evening because my voice didn’t
        open up at all today and it turns out I have damaged my vocal cords. And on medical advice I simply am unable to
        perform over the weekend. To say I’m heart broken would be a complete understatement. I’m already maxed out on steroids
        and aids for my voice. I’ve considered doing Saturday nights show but it’s highly unlikely I’d even make it through
        the set and I simply can’t crumble in front of you all and walk out on you in that way. I’m so desperate to do them
        that I’ve even considered miming, just to be in front of you and be with you. But I’ve never done it and I cannot
        in a million years do that to you. It wouldn’t be the real me up there. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for your disappointment.
        I’m sorry for the nights you would have had with your loved ones and the memories you would have made together. I’m
        sorry for the time and money you’ve spent organizing your trips. You know I would not make this decision lightly.
        I have done 121 shows and I have 2 left. 2 left!!! And they are 2 gigantic shows! Who the fuck cancels a show at
        Wembley Stadium!? To not complete this milestone in my career is something I’m struggling to get my head around and
        I wish that I wasn’t having to write this. I have changed my life drastically in every way to make sure I got through
        this tour that started at the beginning of last year. To not be able to finish it, is something I’m really struggling
        to come to terms with. It’s as if my whole career has been building up to these 4 shows. I’m writing this as the
        decision has just this moment been made, so I don’t have any other information, but of course refunds will be available
        if the shows can’t be rescheduled. There will be more information over the next few days. I’m sorry, I’m devastated.
        I’m sorry. I love you I’m so sorry, please forgive me x
