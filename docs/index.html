        <section class="section section-info">
            <p> I don’t even know how to start this. The last two nights at Wembley have been the biggest and best shows of my
                life. To come home to such a response after so long away doing something I never thought I could pull off
                but did has blown me away. However, I’ve struggled vocally both nights. I had to push a lot harder than I
                normally do. I felt like I constantly had to clear my throat, especially last night. I went to see my throat
                doctor this evening because my voice didn’t open up at all today and it turns out I have damaged my vocal
                cords. And on medical advice I simply am unable to perform over the weekend. To say I’m heart broken would
                be a complete understatement. I’m already maxed out on steroids and aids for my voice. I’ve considered doing
                Saturday nights show but it’s highly unlikely I’d even make it through the set and I simply can’t crumble
                in front of you all and walk out on you in that way. I’m so desperate to do them that I’ve even considered
                miming, just to be in front of you and be with you. But I’ve never done it and I cannot in a million years
                do that to you. It wouldn’t be the real me up there. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for your disappointment. I’m sorry
                for the nights you would have had with your loved ones and the memories you would have made together. I’m
                sorry for the time and money you’ve spent organizing your trips. You know I would not make this decision
                lightly. I have done 121 shows and I have 2 left. 2 left!!! And they are 2 gigantic shows! Who the fuck cancels
                a show at Wembley Stadium!? To not complete this milestone in my career is something I’m struggling to get
                my head around and I wish that I wasn’t having to write this. I have changed my life drastically in every
                way to make sure I got through this tour that started at the beginning of last year. To not be able to finish
                it, is something I’m really struggling to come to terms with. It’s as if my whole career has been building
                up to these 4 shows. I’m writing this as the decision has just this moment been made, so I don’t have any
                other information, but of course refunds will be available if the shows can’t be rescheduled. There will
                be more information over the next few days. I’m sorry, I’m devastated. I’m sorry. I love you I’m so sorry,
                please forgive me x
